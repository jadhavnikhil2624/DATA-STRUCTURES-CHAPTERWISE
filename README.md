# Data Structures Practice Repository

## About

Welcome to my Data Structures Practice Repository! This repository is a collection of daily coding exercises and solutions focused on data structures. My goal is to enhance my understanding of data structures, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and provide a resource for others on a similar learning journey.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this repository is to:

1. **Personal Growth**: Continuously challenge myself by tackling different data structure problems, improving my coding skills, and gaining a deeper understanding of algorithms.

2. **Community Learning**: Share my solutions and insights with the programming community, especially those who are new to data structures and algorithms.

3. **Structured Learning**: Create a structured repository where I can keep track of my progress and refer back to solutions for future reference.

4. **Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration and contributions from others who are passionate about data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

- Each data structure problem is organized in its respective directory.
- Inside each directory, you'll find:
  - A README file explaining the problem and approach.
  - Code solutions in various programming languages.
  - Test cases to validate the solutions.
