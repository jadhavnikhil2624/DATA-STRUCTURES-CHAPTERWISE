# Data Structures Repository

This repository contains various data structures implemented in different programming languages. Each data structure is accompanied by code and relevant explanations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

1. Provide implementations of important data structures.
2. Help individuals learn and understand data structures through code examples and explanations.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this repository by adding more data structures, improving existing implementations, or providing better explanations, here's how you can do it:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures.git
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-data-structure
   ```

4. Make your modifications, adding the data structure code and explanations.

5. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add <data_structure_name> data structure"
   ```

6. Push your changes to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-data-structure
   ```

7. Create a pull request on the original repository.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data-structure-1/`: Folder for Data Structure 1
  - `README.md`: Explanation and usage of Data Structure 1
  - `code.<ext>`: Code implementation in a specific programming language
  - ...

- `data-structure-2/`: Folder for Data Structure 2
  - `README.md`: Explanation and usage of Data Structure 2
  - `code.<ext>`: Code implementation in a specific programming language
  - ...

... (repeat for each data structure)

## Code Guidelines

- Use meaningful variable names and comments to explain the code logic.
- Follow the style conventions of the programming language you are using.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

Feel free to explore the various data structures and contribute to make this repository a valuable resource for everyone!
